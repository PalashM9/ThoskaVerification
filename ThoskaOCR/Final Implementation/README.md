# Overview

This implementation’s standalone feature is one of its most outstanding features. The imple-
mentation was able to complete the digit detection challenge using the ESP32 platform
without the use of high-end camera modules, external storage, or internet access. This
exhibits the ESP32 platform’s real capability and shows how it can be applied to a range
of tasks for which these resources might not be readily available or required.
Overall, this implementation is a great illustration of how to apply machine learning techniques
to practical applications and shows how to obtain standalone functionality using the
ESP32 platform. It demonstrates the strength and potential of machine learning and
emphasizes the value of real-world learning opportunities in the advancement of tech-
nical expertise in this area. We may anticipate seeing a lot more cutting-edge appli-
cations like this one as machine learning develops and spreads, utilizing this potent
technology to address challenging issues and improve numerous industries.
