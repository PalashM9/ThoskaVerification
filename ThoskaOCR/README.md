# Thoska OCR

OCR is an abbreviation for Optical Character Recognition. It is a field of technology that
allows computers to recognize printed or handwritten text in images, scanned docu-
ments, or even a live camera feed and translate it into machine-readable text. OCR is a
crucial component of many text-based applications, including document management
systems, the digitalization of antiquarian books, and automated data entry.
